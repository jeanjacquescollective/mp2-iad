We&#39;ll utilize the 3D camera feature in After Effects, along with a null layer to control the camera movements, and Generative Fill to create Photoshop layers. By the end of this tutorial, you&#39;ll have a basic understanding of how to create engaging 3D videos from static images.</p><h2 id="step-1-create-layers-in-photoshop" tabindex="-1">Step 1: Create layers in Photoshop <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-create-layers-in-photoshop" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Search for an image online that you want to use for your 3D video.</li><li>Open the image in Adobe Photoshop.</li><li>Use the Pen Tool to create a path around the main subject in the image.</li><li>Right-click on the path and select &quot;Make Selection.&quot;</li><li>Copy the selected area and paste it into a new layer.</li><li>Repeat this process for other elements in the image that you want to separate into individual layers.</li></ol><h2 id="step-2-applying-generative-fill-in-photoshop" tabindex="-1">Step 2: Applying Generative Fill in Photoshop <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-applying-generative-fill-in-photoshop" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Select the layer you want to apply Generative Fill to.</li><li>Go to &quot;Edit&quot; &gt; &quot;Content-Aware Fill&quot; in the menu bar.</li><li>Use the tools in the Content-Aware Fill workspace to refine the fill area and generate a new layer.</li><li>Repeat this process for other layers to create clean and separated elements for your 3D video.</li></ol><h2 id="step-3-importing-images" tabindex="-1">Step 3: Importing Images <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-3-importing-images" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Open Adobe After Effects and create a new composition by clicking on &quot;Composition&quot; &gt; &quot;New Composition&quot; in the menu bar.</li><li>Set the desired composition settings such as frame rate, resolution, and duration.</li><li>Import the images you want to use for your 3D video by dragging them into the Project panel or by going to &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Import&quot; &gt; &quot;File...&quot; and selecting your images.</li></ol><h2 id="step-4-setting-up-the-3d-camera" tabindex="-1">Step 4: Setting Up the 3D Camera <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-4-setting-up-the-3d-camera" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Create a new null object by going to &quot;Layer&quot; &gt; &quot;New&quot; &gt; &quot;Null Object.&quot;</li><li>With the null object selected, go to &quot;Layer&quot; &gt; &quot;New&quot; &gt; &quot;Camera&quot; to create a new 3D camera.</li><li>Parent the camera to the null object by dragging the pick-whip icon from the camera layer to the null object layer.</li><li>This will allow you to control the camera movements using the null object.</li></ol><h2 id="step-5-adjusting-camera-settings" tabindex="-1">Step 5: Adjusting Camera Settings <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-5-adjusting-camera-settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Select the 3D camera layer in the timeline.</li><li>Open the Camera Options by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the camera layer.</li><li>Adjust the camera settings such as focal length, depth of field, and aperture to achieve the desired look for your 3D video.</li></ol><h2 id="step-6-animating-camera-movements" tabindex="-1">Step 6: Animating Camera Movements <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-6-animating-camera-movements" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Select the null object layer in the timeline.</li><li>Use the Rotation and Position properties of the null object to animate the camera movements.</li><li>Create keyframes at different points in time to animate the camera&#39;s position and rotation.</li><li>Preview the animation to ensure smooth camera movements.</li></ol><h2 id="step-7-adding-depth-to-the-scene-optional" tabindex="-1">Step 7: Adding Depth to the Scene (Optional) <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-7-adding-depth-to-the-scene-optional" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Experiment with adding depth to your scene by adjusting the Z position of the image layers in 3D space.</li><li>This can create a more immersive effect as the camera moves through the scene.</li></ol><h2 id="step-8-previewing-and-rendering" tabindex="-1">Step 8: Previewing and Rendering <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-8-previewing-and-rendering" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ol><li>Preview your 3D video by pressing the spacebar or clicking on the &quot;Play&quot; button in the Preview panel.</li><li>Once you&#39;re satisfied with the results, go to &quot;Composition&quot; &gt; &quot;Add to Render Queue&quot; to add your composition to the render queue.</li><li>Configure the render settings such as output format, resolution, and frame rate.</li><li>Click on the &quot;Render&quot; button to export your 3D video.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion: <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Congratulations!
