This exercise will help you practice keyframe animation, timing, and easing techniques.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Set Up Your Composition:</strong><ul><li>Open Adobe After Effects and create a new composition. (<code>Ctrl + N</code>)</li><li>Set the dimensions, frame rate, and duration according to your preference.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Import Assets:</strong><ul><li>Import a simple shape or image of a ball into your project. You can use the Ellipse Tool (<code>Q</code>) to create a circle shape layer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Add Background and Floor (Optional):</strong><ul><li>Create a new layer with a solid gradient to serve as the background. (<code>Ctrl + Y</code>)</li><li>Create a white shape or solid layer to represent the floor where the ball will bounce.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create the Bouncing Animation:</strong><ul><li>Position the ball at the top of the composition.</li><li>Add a keyframe for the ball&#39;s position property. (<code>P</code>)</li><li>Move the playhead to a later point in time and adjust the ball&#39;s position downward to simulate the first bounce.</li><li>Add another keyframe for the new position. (<code>Ctrl + Shift + K</code>)</li><li>Repeat this process to create additional bounces until the ball comes to rest.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adjust Timing and Easing:</strong><ul><li>Experiment with the timing between keyframes to achieve a natural-looking bounce.</li><li>Use easing options such as Easy Ease (<code>F9</code>) or Easy Ease Out (<code>Shift + F9</code>) to add smoothness to the animation.</li><li>Adjust the speed graph in the Graph Editor (<code>Ctrl + 8</code>) to fine-tune the velocity of the ball&#39;s movement.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Add Secondary Motion (Optional):</strong><ul><li>To enhance realism, consider adding secondary motion effects such as squash and stretch as the ball bounces.</li><li>Create keyframes for the scale property of the ball layer at keyframes where it hits the ground. Decrease the scale slightly on impact and increase it as the ball rebounds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Add X-Axis Movement (Optional):</strong><ul><li>Create keyframes for the position property of the ball layer to add horizontal movement. (<code>Alt + Shift + P</code>)</li><li>Shift the position of the ball to the left or right to simulate movement along the x-axis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Add Matte and Rotation (Optional):</strong><ul><li>Create a matte layer to mask the ball&#39;s movement, giving the illusion of it rolling on a surface.</li><li>Apply rotation keyframes to the ball layer to make it rotate as it moves and bounces.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Preview and Refine:</strong><ul><li>Preview your animation frequently to assess the movement and make adjustments as needed. (<code>Spacebar</code> to play/pause)</li><li>Pay attention to the spacing and timing of the bounces to ensure a convincing result.</li></ul></li></ol>',4),n=[l];function r(s,c,d,h,u,f){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const g=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
