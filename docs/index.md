# Interactive audiovisual design

In this course we will learn how to transfer our audiovisual knowledge and assets to an interactive design. The course will consist of different programs whom we will discover trough small assignments and knowledge clips.

## P5 and interactive sites

> p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. <br><br>
> Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you’re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

from [p5.org](https://p5js.org/)

P5 evolved from Processing, a library with a custom IDE loved by many free spirits and generative coders. They still share the same open-source idea's and have contributors from all round the world.
