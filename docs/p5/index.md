# P5.js 

## Introduction

First of, what is P5? 

> p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. <br><br>
> Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

from [p5.org](https://p5js.org/)

There are plenty of possibilities to start with P5 (or processing).
We can make use of the [processing IDE](), [the code editor for P5]() or import the library and setting up a site/server.

We will go for the last (and hardest) option, so we can easily expand this into future projects.

## Requirements

We will install Visual Studio Code as our Code editor. You can install and download it from [their website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Secondly we will install some plugins to make are life easier. 

### p5.vscode

- Open the Command Palette (with command-shift-p on Mac, or ctrl-shift-p on Windows) and then start typing and select Create p5.js Project.
- Select a new empty folder to put your project in.
- (optional) click the "Go Live" button in the bottom status bar to open your sketch in a browser

## Our first circle 

Make a new folder for this course and make another subfolder with the name of p5. 
Open this folder in VSCode, we can use one of the two methods.

### Method 1 

Mac: drag your folder to Visual Studio Code
Win: open the folder in your Command Line and type 'code .'

### Method 2

Open Visual Studio Code, go to file > Open Folder > select folder.

### Setting up the scene

So before we start we need a couple of things, luckely the plugin will arrange the files for us.
Press `ctrl+ shift + p` and select `create p5.js project`.

You'll see a couple files/folders being generated.

- libraries 
- index.html
- jsconfig.json
- sketch.js
- style.css

In the `libraries`-folder we can find the imported files. In this case `p5.min.js` and `p5.sound.min.js`.

index.html: our starting point.
jsconfig.js: Configuration settings for compiler.
sketch.js: our main JavaScript-file. 
style.css: our main style-file.

### Coming full circle

Open up the index.html and press `go live` in the ribbon on the bottom right of the screen.
A new page will open in your chosen browser, for me this is Firefox Developer Edition.
You see a grey rectangle in the corner of the screen. 
This is produced by the code in `sketch.js`.

We can adjust this code to our needs.
```js
function setup() { // this part get executed at the start
  createCanvas(400, 400); // this function creates a canvas with 400 width and 400 height

}

function draw() { // draw is called every frame
  background(220); // this is a grey background
}
```

If we want more information about certain topics or functions, there is some exquisite documentation at [the regerence site](https://p5js.org/reference/).

We will now add a ellipse to the scene, add `ellipse(50,50,80,80);` to the draw function. 

```js
function draw() {
  background(220);
  ellipse(50,50,80,80);
}
```

## Animating

That is one thing, let's make this randomized: `ellipse(random(0,101),50,80,80);`

Woah, kindoff hectic. Let's smooth this out, we use a lot of sine/cosine-functions for that. 

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  ellipse(sin(millis()*.001)*50+50,50,80,80);
}
```

## User input

Change the draw function to following code 

```js
function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
```

## And now?

Plenty of things to discover!
