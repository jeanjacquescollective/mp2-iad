# Tutorial: Creating a DVD Logo Motion Path Animation in Adobe After Effects

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to recreate the iconic DVD logo motion path animation using Adobe After Effects. This fun exercise will help you practice motion graphics and animation techniques.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Composition:

1. Open Adobe After Effects and create a new composition.
2. Set the dimensions, frame rate, and duration for your composition. For example, you can use 1920x1080 pixels, 30 frames per second, and 10 seconds duration.

## Step 2: Create the DVD Logo:

1. Import an image of a DVD logo into your project. You can find this image online or use a vector graphic for better quality.
2. Drag the DVD logo image into your composition to create a new layer.

## Step 3: Animate the Motion Path:

1. Select the DVD logo layer in the timeline.
2. With the layer selected, choose the Pen Tool from the toolbar (shortcut: G).
3. Click to create a point on the screen where you want the DVD logo to start its motion path.
4. Continue clicking to create additional points to define the motion path. Try to create a curved path for a smooth animation.
5. Once you've created the motion path, close the path by clicking on the first point you created.
6. After Effects will automatically create keyframes for the Position property of the DVD logo layer, animating it along the motion path you created.

## Step 4: Adjust Timing and Easing:

1. Select the keyframes in the timeline that represent the motion path animation.
2. Right-click on one of the keyframes and choose "Keyframe Assistant" > "Easy Ease" to apply easing to the animation.
3. Adjust the speed graph in the Graph Editor to fine-tune the velocity of the motion path. You can access the Graph Editor by selecting the keyframes and pressing the "Graph Editor" button in the timeline.

## Step 5: Preview and Refine:

1. Preview your animation to see how the DVD logo moves along the motion path.
2. Make any necessary adjustments to the motion path or easing to achieve the desired result.
3. Experiment with adding effects like motion blur to enhance the realism of the animation.
