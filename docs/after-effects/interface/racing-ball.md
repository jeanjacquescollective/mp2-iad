**Tutorial: Creating a New Composition and Basic Animation in Adobe After Effects**

1. **Create a New Composition:**
    - Open Adobe After Effects and go to the top menu bar.
    - Select "Composition" > "New Composition."
    - Set the following parameters:
        - **Composition Name:** Give your composition a descriptive name.
        - **Width and Height:** Define the dimensions of your canvas in pixels.
        - **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Typically set to "Square Pixels (1.0)."
        - **Frame Rate:** Choose a frame rate (e.g., 24fps, 30fps, 60fps).
        - **Duration:** Set the duration of your composition in seconds.
        - **Background Color:** Choose the background color or make it transparent.
        - **Resolution:** Choose "Full" or "Half" resolution.
        - **Start Timecode:** Define the starting timecode for your composition.
        - **Duration:** Specify the length of your composition.
        - **Preview Panel:** Configure advanced settings for playback performance.
2. **Create an Ellipse Shape:**
    - Select the Ellipse Tool from the top toolbar.
    - Click and drag on the composition window to create an ellipse shape. Hold down the Shift key to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio.
3. **Adjust Rotation Center:**
    - Select the ellipse layer.
    - Press 'R' to reveal the Rotation property.
    - Notice how it rotates around a center point.
    - To fix this, select the Anchor Point Tool from the toolbar.
    - Click and drag the anchor point while holding Ctrl or Cmd to snap it to a desired location.
4. **Basic Animation:**
    - Rotate the ellipse layer again to see the difference.
    - Rename the layer to "linear speed."
    - Open the Position property by pressing 'P'.
    - Show all possible properties by clicking the arrow next to the property name and pressing 'U'.
    - Add a keyframe at the start, move to 1 second, then add another keyframe.
    - Move the layer horizontally while holding Shift.
    - Adjust playback by dragging the blue indicator or pressing 'N' for end and 'I' for start.
5. **Creating a Second Ellipse:**
    - Create another ellipse without selecting any layer.
    - Try to repeat the same steps for rotation and animation.
    - Alternatively, duplicate the existing ellipse layer for an easier approach.
    - Change the color and name of the new ellipse layer.
6. **Animating with Ease:**
    - Select both keyframes and move them to adjust timing.
    - Explain easing options, such as linear and easy ease.
    - Show the difference between ease in and ease out.
    - View animation curves by selecting the graph editor with 'Alt' key.
